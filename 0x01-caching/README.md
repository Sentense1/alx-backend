0x01. Caching

Cache replacement policies are strategies used in cache management to determine which items to remove from the cache when it becomes full and a new item needs to be added. Several common cache replacement policies include:

Least Recently Used (LRU): In an LRU cache, the item that has not been accessed for the longest time is removed first. This policy is implemented using data structures like queues or linked lists, where the most recently used item is moved to the front.

Most Recently Used (MRU): The MRU policy removes the most recently used item from the cache when it becomes full. It's the opposite of LRU. However, MRU is not as common as LRU in practice.

First-In, First-Out (FIFO): In a FIFO cache, the item that was added to the cache earliest is removed first. This is typically implemented as a queue, where the item that was enqueued first is dequeued first.

Least Frequently Used (LFU): In an LFU cache, the item that has been accessed the least number of times is removed first. LFU keeps track of the access frequency of items and removes the least frequently used item when needed.

Random Replacement (RR): The RR policy selects items to remove at random. It doesn't consider the access history or frequency and simply chooses a random item for eviction.

Cache-Aware Replacement Policies: Some replacement policies take into account the specific characteristics of the cache and the workload. These policies can be more complex and tailored to the application's needs.

In Python, you can implement these cache replacement policies using various data structures, such as dictionaries, lists, queues, or custom classes. The choice of which policy to use depends on the specific requirements of your application.
